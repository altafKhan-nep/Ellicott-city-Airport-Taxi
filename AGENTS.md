# RideTaxi - Developer Guide

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd client && npm install
cd ../server && npm install

# Environment setup
cp .env.example .env  # Add MongoDB URI, JWT secrets

# Run dev servers (separate terminals)
cd client && npm run dev    # http://localhost:5173
cd server && npm run dev    # http://localhost:5001
```

> **macOS gotcha**: Port `5000` is often taken by ControlCenter/AirPlay. The backend defaults to **5001**. If you change it, also update `client/vite.config.js` proxy targets.

## Design System (Cargo — blue-led, faithful to /transport-company/)

All design tokens live in `client/src/index.css` inside the Tailwind `@theme` block.
**Keep token NAMES stable** — ~40 components reference them by name, so you change a color
*value*, never a class.

Palette and type extracted from the **Cargo** WordPress theme (Bold Themes), sampled on
`cargo.bold-themes.com/transport-company/` from live computed styles.

**MAJOR — Cargo blue `#0B60A9`** (deep `#084274`). On that page it is 96 text uses, 16 backgrounds
and 9 borders — far and away the color the theme is built on. Deep blue carries the nav/hero/footer
bands, CTAs, buttons, links and focus rings.

| Token family | Role | Key values |
|--------------|------|------------|
| `brand-*` | **BLUE = the major**: bands, CTAs, links, focus rings, chips | `brand-200 #c2d9ec`, `brand-400 #2f87bd`, `brand-500 #0b6ba8`, `brand-600 #0b60a9`, `brand-700 #08487e`, `brand-800 #084274`, `brand-950 #04203a` |
| `gold-*` | Legacy name, now Cargo's **light-blue accent** (`#2995F1` family): accent words and live dots **on** the blue band, "waiting/pending" chips | `gold-300 #8fbcdd`, `gold-400 #a5cce6`, `gold-600 #0b6ba8`, `gold-700 #08487e` |
| `signal-*` | **The only red.** Functional meaning, never branding | `signal-500 #d62f2f`, `signal-600 #c22020`, `signal-700 #a81c1c` |
| `accent-*` | Cargo's neutral family: borders `#CCCCCC`, muted `#666`, charcoal section band `#313131`, light band `#EDEDED` | `accent-100 #ededed`, `accent-200 #cccccc`, `accent-500 #6b6b6b`, `accent-800 #313131` |
| `success-*` | Cargo green `#00D084` — done / paid / online (also the map pickup pin) | `success-500 #00d084`, `success-600 #008252` |
| `ink` / `muted` / `paper` | Body text `#333333`, muted, light neutral body | `ink #333333`, `muted #61656b`, `paper #f2f2f2` |
| Fonts | **Raleway** (headings + body, 170 elements) **and Lato** (menus / small UI, 168 elements) | Google Fonts, in `client/index.html` |

Cargo uses **two families**: `--font-sans`/`--font-display` = Raleway, and `--font-ui` = Lato, applied
via the `font-ui` utility to menus and nav. There is **no orange in the theme** — an earlier revision
of this design added one; it has been removed.

> **Why some values differ from Cargo's literal hexes.** Cargo ships raw colors, several of which
> FAIL WCAG AA as text — its `#00D084` green is 1.9:1 on a light tint and `#999999` is 2.8:1. We keep
> Cargo's hues and re-tune each role to the lightest value that still clears 4.5:1.
> **Run `npm run check:contrast` before changing any color value here** — it asserts all 51 rendered
> combinations and exits non-zero on a regression.

Usage rules:
- **Blue leads the structure.** `bg-brand-gradient` (`brand-800 → 950`) is the surface for
  nav/hero/footer/CTA bands. `bg-band-charcoal` (`#313131`) and `bg-band-light` (`#EDEDED`) are the
  other two band treatments Cargo uses. `bg-brand-gradient-soft` is the wash between bands.
- **CTAs are blue, not charcoal** — `btn-brand-gradient` runs `brand-500 → brand-700`; white text needs
  ≥4.5:1.
- **Light blue is the accent on the band** — hero accent words, live dots and ratings on blue bands
  use `text-gold-300` / `bg-gold-400`.
- **Red is functional only.** Never use `signal-*` for branding, decoration or emphasis. If something
  needs to read as "active / failed", that is the only correct use.
- Pills everywhere (Uber-style touch targets): `rounded-full` inputs (`input-pill`), buttons, chips.
- Functional map colors are the ONLY exceptions to the token system: pickup = circular green
  `map-pin-start` (`success-500`), dropoff = red `map-pin-dropoff` (`signal-700`), driver = pulsing
  red `map-pin-driver` (`signal-600`). Leaflet `pathOptions` need a raw hex, so the route line uses
  **`ROUTE_RED` from `lib/mapColors.js`** — the one place that hex is defined, imported by
  `BookingMap.jsx` / `RideTracking.jsx` / `LiveMapPage.tsx` / `ActiveRidePanel.jsx` /
  `CurrentRidePage.tsx`. The "you are here" dot is Cargo blue (`PICKUP_BLUE`).
- Depth comes from layered shadows: `.card-lift` (resting 2-layer shadow, float on hover).
- The 3D hero taxi keeps its **glossy black** paint and red taillights (a physical object, not a
  brand surface). Never recolor the body.
- Type scale is Tailwind's default (`text-xs`…`text-6xl`). **Do not copy Cargo's 13px body** — it
  fails readability for a booking funnel; `text-sm` (14px) is our floor for UI text.

**Hard rule — no raw Tailwind palette colors.** Only `brand-*`, `accent-*`, `gold-*`, `success-*`,
`signal-*`, `ink`, `muted`, `paper`, `surface` may appear in components. Never `slate-*`, `blue-*`,
`green-*`, `red-*`, `amber-*`, `yellow-*`, `gray-*`, `orange-*`. Semantic mapping: blue → `brand`
(800-950), red-as-signal → `signal`, green → `success`, yellow/amber/orange → `gold` (the accent
role), slate/gray → `accent`, `bg-white` → `bg-surface` (so dark mode works).

**Shared surfaces & tones (use these, never re-declare):**
| Utility / module | Use for |
|------------------|---------|
| `.card` | Standard padded card (radius 1rem, `accent-200` border, `surface` bg, layered shadow, lifts on hover). Override padding with `card p-6` / `card p-8`. Defined in `@layer components`, so utilities win. |
| `.panel` | Same surface with **no** padding and no hover lift — tables, dropdowns, map frames (`panel overflow-hidden`). |
| `.card-lift` | Animation only, for image/media cards that define their own surface. |
| `.bg-dots` | Dotted **world map** (dark ink) over the element's existing surface. Cargo's dotted-map background, regenerated as original SVG. |
| `.bg-dots-soft` | The same map **composited with** the soft wash — use this *instead of* `bg-brand-gradient-soft`, because setting `background-image` would wipe the gradient out. |
| `.bg-dots-brand` | Map **composited with** the blue band gradient — replaces `bg-brand-gradient` for the same reason. Uses the *light* asset, since a dark dot on a dark band measures 1.03:1, i.e. invisible. |
| `.phone-number` | Standard plain phone presentation: body font (never a serif), weight 500, `lining-nums` so the digits sit on a flat baseline, normal tracking, no transform. A phone is a value to read and tap, not a display element — never set it in `font-display` or extra-bold, and never in a serif face (its curved figures read as "wavy"). |
| `.bg-dots-parallax` | Opt-in `background-attachment: fixed`. Off by default: unreliable on iOS Safari and a scroll-performance cost. |
| `lib/phone.js` | `formatPhoneDisplay()` — the only place the phone number's *display* format is decided. |
| `lib/statusTone.js` | `rideTone()`, `payTone()`, `payAccent()`, `badgeTone()` — the only place status/payment colors are defined, so every page renders identical pills. Never re-declare a `STATUS_STYLE` map. |

| `/driver` | driver/Dashboard.jsx | driver | Accept rides, location broadcast |
| `/admin` | modules/crm (live) | admin | Overview, Rides, Dispatch, Drivers, Fleet, Payments, Content, Users, Settings |
| `/admin/content` | modules/crm/features/content | admin | **Content & catalog hub** — Website content \| Fleet \| Services |

\* `/reservations` is viewable by anyone, but the request button prompts login.

**Content & catalog hub** (`modules/crm/features/content/`) — the one screen an owner uses to run the
business. `ContentPage.tsx` is a 3-tab shell over `ContentEditor.tsx` (site copy), `FleetManager.tsx`
and `ServicesManager.tsx`, sharing the primitives in `fields.tsx`.
- Site copy edits a local draft, shows per-section "unsaved" dots, a live hero preview, a sticky save
  bar (dirty count + discard) and supports `⌘/Ctrl+S`; `beforeunload` guards a tab close.
- Tabs are addressable (`#content` / `#fleet` / `#services`): the shell `pushState`s on click and
  listens for `hashchange`/`popstate`, so deep links and browser back/forward both switch tabs.
- Fleet/Services are immediate-save list managers: reorder arrows, a right slide-over `Drawer` for
  add/edit, `Confirm` dialogs that explain the delete guard, and a toast for the outcome.
  Lists carry `usage: { rides, drivers }` so the UI can warn *before* an admin hits a 409.
- Boot seeding never overwrites: `ensureCatalogDefaults()` only runs on an empty collection, and
  `restore-defaults` re-adds missing rows only. Deleting a class therefore sticks.

**Reservations flow** (`passenger/Reservations.jsx`):
1. `LocationSearch` (autocomplete → `GET /api/places/search`) sets pickup/dropoff.
2. `BookingMap` shows nearby vehicles (`GET /api/drivers/nearby`) once pickup is set.
3. Selecting a driver calls `GET /api/drivers/:id/eta` → draws dashed route to pickup + shows ETA strip.
4. Submit → `POST /api/rides` → navigate to `/rides/track/:id`.

## Real Business Info (from ellicottcityairporttaxi.com)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Phone | (410) 365-5556 → `tel:4103655556` |
| Email | chriskbonsu@gmail.com |
| Address | 9019 Early April Way, Ellicott City, MD |
| Service area | Maryland, DC, Virginia (local & long distance, door-to-door) |
| Legal name | Ellicott City Airport Taxi |

Used in `Footer.jsx` (contact column) and the `tel:`/`mailto:` CTAs on marketing pages.

**Navbar** (`components/layout/Navbar.jsx`) — one `NAV_LINKS` array feeds both the desktop bar and the
mobile drawer, so a page can never appear in one and be missing from the other. Every control shares
one `h-10` height and one `rounded-full` radius; all text clears WCAG AA against the red band. The
drawer locks body scroll while open, `Escape` closes either menu and restores focus, and the Services
menu is a 2-up card that scrolls instead of overflowing. Role-gated links (`Admin` for any CRM role,
`Driver`) come from `lib/roles.js`, not an inline `role === 'admin'` test.

## 3D Hero Taxi (Home page)

`pages/marketing/Home.jsx` embeds a WebGL taxi behind the hero content (desktop/tablet only).
It is lazy-loaded so the ~265KB gzip three.js bundle only downloads when a supported,
non-mobile viewport actually renders it.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `components/three/HeroTaxiScene.jsx` | `<Canvas>` + Suspense + lights + rig |
| `components/three/TaxiRig.jsx` | GSAP entrance, idle bob, mouse parallax (all lerped) |
| `components/three/TaxiModel.jsx` | Loads `/models/taxi.glb` if present, else procedural taxi |
| `components/three/ProceduralTaxi.jsx` | Real 3D sedan built from primitives (body, glass, wheels, decals) |
| `components/three/TaxiLights.jsx` | Ambient + key + warm fill + cyan rim |
| `components/three/StudioEnvironment.js` | `RoomEnvironment` PMREM → soft paint/glass reflections (no HDR file) |
| `components/three/ShadowDisc.jsx` | Soft radial shadow attached to the taxi group |
| `hooks/useMediaQuery.js`, `useWebGLSupport.js`, `three/useModelAvailable.js` | Responsive / feature detection |

**Dependencies** (v10+ of the app): `three`, `@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei`, `gsap`.

Rules:
- **GLB override**: drop a taxi model at `client/public/models/taxi.glb` — it is auto-detected
  (HEAD + content-type check) and normalized to ~4.6 units. A missing file 404s gracefully to the
  procedural model. No flat images, ever.
- **Layering**: taxi layer is `z-[6]`, `pointer-events-none`, `aria-hidden`; hero text + booking
  card are `z-10` above it. The card stays fully interactive.
- **Responsive**: hidden on `<768px` and when WebGL is unavailable; tablets get a compact variant.
- **Reduced motion**: `prefers-reduced-motion` disables entrance + parallax + idle; taxi is static.
- **Branding**: door decals ("RideTaxi · Howard County") + roof "TAXI" sign are canvas textures
  rendered at runtime — no external font/asset downloads.
- **Paint**: procedural model is a glossy black sedan (`#1c1c21` PBR, white DRLs, red taillights)
  — a realistic black car. Keep it black (never red/amber).

cd server && npm run seed       # Seed test data
```

## Testing

There are three layers, and they exist because of specific failures rather than
because testing is conventional here.

| Command | What it covers | Why it exists |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| `server: npm test` | 44 API tests against a **real** MongoDB (`mongodb-memory-server`) | The bugs that bit us were schema/data bugs, which mocks cannot catch — see below |
| `client: npm test` | 25 unit tests: `lib/phone.js`, `lib/quote.js`, catalog fallback | These are the pure functions that carry money and phone formatting |
| `client: npm run test:e2e` | 22 browser tests across the **web ↔ API seam** | Pages degraded quietly rather than crashing; the assertions cover the degraded path too |
| `client: npm run check:catalog` | client fallback vs server defaults | Diffs the two lists field by field; exits non-zero on drift |

**Why the server tests use a real database.** The driver-verification workflow
added a field defaulting to `'none'` and, correctly, refused to let unverified
drivers go online. That locked out every driver who already existed — including
both seeded accounts — and it was only noticed because the person running the
seed got locked out. A mocked model would have passed that change happily.
`server/tests/driverVerification.test.js` and `server/tests/seed.test.js` exist
purely to pin that, and the seed test runs the **real seed script** as a child
process so it tests the documented setup rather than a reconstruction of it.

**`src/index.js` exports `app` and boots only when run directly** (guarded by
`isDirectRun`). Importing it in a test neither binds a port nor opens a second
database connection; `node src/index.js` is unchanged.

**Always run the seed test after touching the seed or the User schema.** Adding a
field with a default has broken this project once already, and the migration that
papered over it (`npm run migrate:drivers`) is a manual step nothing enforces.

**CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the static gates first, then the server
tests, client tests, and finally the browser suite against a real API and a
`mongodb:7` service container. The API runs with `NODE_ENV=development` there
because `assertEnv()` deliberately refuses a localhost `MONGO_URI` in production;
the production boot guards are covered by `server/tests/env.test.js` instead.

## Data Models

### User
```js
{
  _id, name, email, phone, password: (hashed),
  role: "passenger" | "driver" | "admin",
  avatar, createdAt, updatedAt,          // avatar = base64 data-URL (no external storage)
  emailVerified: Boolean,                // default false
  isSuspended: Boolean,                  // default false — protect + login reject suspended users
  pushSubscriptions: [{ endpoint, keys: { p256dh, auth } }],  // web-push endpoints
  authProvider: "local" | "google" | "facebook" | "phone",
  tokenVersion: Number,                  // bumped on logout / password reset to revoke JWTs
  verificationToken: { token, expiresAt } | null,  // hashed, 24h
  resetToken: { token, expiresAt } | null,          // hashed, 1h
  driverDetails: {
    vehicleType: "executive-sedan" | "economy-sedan" | "economy-suv" | "premium-suv" | "luxury-suv" | "van" | "mini-coach" | "school-bus" | "motorcoach",
    plateNumber, licenseNo, isAvailable: Boolean
  }
}
```
Statics: `findByEmail` / `findByPhone` / `findByLogin` (email-or-phone regex autodetect, all `.select('+password')`).

Fleet classes and services are **admin-managed catalog data**, not code. `data/vehicles.js` and
`data/services.js` are now only the offline fallback behind `CatalogContext`; the live source of
truth is the `FleetVehicle` / `ServiceOffering` collections (see below). Both are validated against
the catalog on every write path (ride create/edit, driver registration, CRM vehicle create/update),
so a key must exist and be active or the request 400s. A vehicle type that is referenced by rides or
drivers can be renamed in its `label` and deactivated, but **cannot be deleted or have its `key`
changed** (409) — deactivate it instead, which keeps history intact.

### Ride
```js
{
  _id,
  passenger: ref(User),
  driver: ref(User) | null,
  pickup: { address, lat, lng },
  dropoff: { address, lat, lng },
  vehicleType,                    // FleetVehicle.key — admin-managed, validated on write
  serviceType,                    // ServiceOffering.slug, or "" for none — admin-managed, validated on write
  passengerCount, bags,
  status: "pending" | "accepted" | "arriving" | "in_progress" | "completed" | "cancelled",
  fare: { estimated, final, currency, distanceKm, durationMin },
  route: [{ lat, lng }],           // Polyline from OSRM
  timestamps: { requested, accepted, arrived, started, completed },
  payment: { method, status, transactionId }
}
```

### Location (driver positions)
```js
{
  driver: ref(User),
  coordinates: { lat, lng },
  heading, speed,
  updatedAt                        // TTL index for auto-cleanup
}
```

### RefreshToken (server-side sessions)
```js
{
  user: ref(User),
  tokenHash,                       // SHA-256 of the opaque refresh token
  expiresAt,                       // TTL index -> MongoDB auto-deletes expired
  revokedAt: Date | null,
  rememberMe, userAgent, ip,
  createdAt, updatedAt
}
```

### OtpCode (phone sign-in)
```js
{
  phone,                          // indexed
  codeHash,                       // SHA-256 of the 6-digit code
  expiresAt,                      // TTL index (10 min)
  attempts,                       // max 5 before the code is voided
  createdAt, updatedAt
}
```

### Payment (Stripe + cash + sandbox fallback)
```js
{
  user: ref(User), ride: ref(Ride),
  amount, currency,
  method: "card" | "wallet" | "cash",
  provider: "stripe" | "sandbox" | "cash",
  status: "pending" | "succeeded" | "failed" | "refunded" | "cash",
  transactionId,                  // unique + sparse; pi_… for Stripe, txn_… for sandbox
  idempotencyKey,                 // unique + sparse — caller key prevents double-charge
  failureReason, cardLast4,
  refundedAt, refundTransactionId,
  createdAt, updatedAt
}
```
**Cash**: `POST pay` with `{ method: "cash" }` records a no-charge payment (status
`cash`, provider `cash`); the passenger pays the driver at trip end. Never
refundable, allowed even when `paymentsEnabled=false`. Once a ride is settled
(either `succeeded` or `cash`) it is returned as-is — never charged again.

**Stripe (online card)**: when `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is set in `server/.env`,
card payments go through real Stripe Payment Intents. Flow:
1. `POST /api/rides/:rideId/payment-intent` → `{ clientSecret, amount }` (idempotent per ride).
2. Client confirms with the Payment Element (`stripe.confirmPayment`, `redirect: 'if_required'`).
3. `POST pay` with `{ method: "card", paymentIntentId }` — server retrieves the
   intent, verifies `status === 'succeeded'` and amount == ride fare, then records
   it (provider `stripe`, transactionId = `pi_…`).
Unconfirmed/declined intents are rejected (400). Refunds call `stripe.refunds.create`.
The account's Payment Method Configuration is applied automatically via
`automatic_payment_methods: { enabled: true }` — the `pmd_…` Payment Method
Domain id in `server/.env` is informational (dashboard config); do NOT pass it as
`payment_method_configuration` (that param needs a `pmc_…` id).

**Sandbox (fallback)**: when `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is unset, card payments use the
simulated gateway — card ending `0002` always declines, `0000` always succeeds,
otherwise ~95% success. Stripe is preferred once configured.

### Notification (in-app)
```js
{
  user: ref(User, indexed),
  type: "ride" | "payment" | "account" | "system",
  title, message,
  data: {},                        // e.g. { rideId } for deep links
  read: Boolean, readAt,
  createdAt
}
```
`notificationService.notify()` writes the row and fans out to the socket room
`user:{id}` (`notification:new`), plus email / SMS / web-push when configured.
`Notification` is the ONLY persisted record — external channels are fire-and-forget.

### FleetVehicle (admin-managed fleet catalog)
```js
{
  key,                             // unique + immutable once in use: "executive-sedan"
  label, desc, capacity,           // display copy ("Executive Sedan", "1–4 passengers")
  seats, bags,                     // numeric, used to pre-fill the booking form
  image,                           // path in client/public, "" = fall back to the icon
  tagline, features: [],           // public Fleet page copy
  icon,                            // a name from client/src/lib/iconMap.js ICONS
  fare: { base, perKm, perMin },   // class rates; global AppSetting overrides still win
  active, sortOrder,
}
```
`catalogService.FLEET_DEFAULTS` holds the 9 seeded classes and is inserted on boot **only when the
collection is empty** — deleting a class is not undone by a restart. `POST /api/admin/fleet/restore-defaults`
re-adds any *missing* default without touching classes an admin has edited.

### ServiceOffering (admin-managed service catalog)
```js
{
  slug,                            // unique + immutable once in use: "airport"
  name, short, tagline, summary,
  features: [],
  icon,                            // a name from client/src/lib/iconMap.js ICONS
  featured,                        // shows in the Home featured band
  active, sortOrder,
}
```
`catalogService.SERVICE_DEFAULTS` holds the 10 seeded services, seeded the same way.

### AppSetting (admin-editable key/value)
```js
{ key: String, unique, value: Mixed }
```
Known keys (defaults in `settingsService.DEFAULTS`): `baseFare`, `perKm`,
`perMin` (optional fare overrides on top of the per-class `FleetVehicle.fare` rates — `null`/0 = use
the class rates), `paymentsEnabled` (toggle), `supportPhone`, `supportEmail`, and `siteContent` (see
the Website content section). `GET /api/settings` exposes a public subset.

## API Endpoints

### Auth
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register (validates name/email/password >= 6/phone format; 409 on duplicate email). Creates unverified user + sends verification email; returns `verificationLink` in non-production.
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login with **email OR phone** + password (Passport LocalStrategy). Body: `{ identifier, rememberMe }` (or `{ email }`/`{ phone }`). `rememberMe` = true → 30d refresh, else 7d.
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` - **Rotates** the opaque refresh token (old one is revoked atomically). Rejects replays/concurrent reuse (exactly one success). Rejects if `tokenVersion` changed.
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - **Auth required.** Body `{ refreshToken }` — revokes that device's session.
- `GET /api/auth/google` / `GET /api/auth/facebook` - Passport OAuth2 **redirect** start. 503 if provider not configured. On success the provider bounces back to the callback which issues tokens and redirects to `{CLIENT_ORIGIN}/auth/social?accessToken=&refreshToken=`.
- `GET /api/auth/google/callback` / `GET /api/auth/facebook/callback` - OAuth2 callback → find-or-create/link user → tokens → SPA.
- `POST /api/auth/otp/send` - Body `{ phone }`. Sends a 6-digit SMS code (Twilio, or console + `devCode` in dev). Rate-limited (5/10min/IP).
- `POST /api/auth/otp/verify` - Body `{ phone, code }`. One-time code (10 min TTL, 5 attempts). Find-or-creates a `phone`-provider user and issues tokens.
- `POST /api/auth/verify-email` - Body `{ token }`. Marks `emailVerified`, clears `verificationToken` (24h expiry).
- `POST /api/auth/resend-verification` - Body `{ email }`.
- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` - Body `{ email }`. Sends reset link (1h expiry); returns `resetLink` in non-production.
- `POST /api/auth/reset-password` - Body `{ token, password }`. Also bumps `tokenVersion` (signs out all sessions).
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Current user profile (auth required)

### Rides
- `POST /api/rides` - Request ride (passenger)
- `GET /api/rides` - List rides (filtered by role)
- `GET /api/rides/:id` - Ride details

- `POST /api/rides/:rideId/pay` - Charge/settle a ride (passenger): `{ method: "cash" }`
  records a no-charge cash payment; `{ method: "card", paymentIntentId }` records a
  Stripe charge. Idempotent (see Payment model).
- `POST /api/rides/:rideId/payment-intent` - Stripe PaymentIntent `{ clientSecret, amount }`
  for the card tab of the pay modal (idempotent per ride).

### Users / Profile
- `GET /api/users/me` - Profile (name, email, phone, avatar, role)
- `PATCH /api/users/me` - Edit name / phone
- `POST /api/users/me/avatar` - Body `{ dataUrl }` (base64 image, ≤512KB). Stored in Mongo.
- `DELETE /api/users/me/avatar` - Remove avatar
- `PATCH /api/users/me/password` - Body `{ currentPassword, newPassword }` (≥6 chars). Keeps current session.

### Payments

- `PATCH /api/drivers/availability` - Toggle on/off duty

### Catalog (public — the live fleet + services)
- `GET /api/fleet` - Active vehicle classes, in `sortOrder` (no fares — public pricing stays private)
- `GET /api/services` - Active service offerings; `featured: true` marks the Home featured band

- `POST /api/admin/fleet` - Create (key auto-validated, must be kebab-case)
- `PATCH /api/admin/fleet/:id` - Update; `fare` is merged, `key` is immutable once referenced (409)
- `DELETE /api/admin/fleet/:id` - Delete; **409** when rides or drivers still reference the key

  `POST /api/admin/services/restore-defaults` - Same shape as the fleet routes (`usage: { rides }`)

## Socket.io Events

**Handshake is JWT-only.** The client sends `{ auth: { token } }` (`socketService.connectSocket(role)`); the server verifies it, loads the `User`, and derives the role from the database. The legacy `{ userId, role }` handshake is **ignored** — trusting it let any socket claim `admin` and read every room. A socket with no token is allowed to connect but joins no rooms and receives no privileged events. `tokenVersion` (logout-all / password reset) and `isSuspended` are both re-checked on connect.

### Client → Server
- `authenticate` `{ userId, role }` - Join `user:{id}` room (drivers also join `drivers` room; admins join `admins` room)
- `ride:join` `{ rideId }` - Join `ride:{rideId}` room. **Authorized only for the ride's passenger, its assigned driver, or admins** (locations flow through these rooms — unauthenticated joins are rejected).
- `driver:location` `{ lat, lng, heading, speed }` - Driver position. **Server looks up the driver's active ride and forwards to `ride:{id}` room only.** Do NOT broadcast to all drivers/passengers.
- `passenger:location` `{ lat, lng, heading, speed }` - Passenger position. Mirror of `driver:location` — forwarded to the passenger's active `ride:{id}` room so the assigned driver sees them live.
- `ride:chat` `{ rideId, text }` - Chat message. Restricted to the ride's passenger, its driver, or admins.
- `ride:cancel` `{ rideId }` - Cancel ride (server re-validates)

### Server → Client
- `ride:update` `{ ride, status }` - Ride status changed (ride room; admins also receive via `admins` room for live dispatch UI)
- `ride:new` `{ ride }` - New pending ride → **only the nearby, available drivers whose vehicle matches** (per-driver `user:{id}` rooms; the ride's passenger + admin also see it via `notification:new`). Used for the driver feed.
- `ride:driverFound` `{ driver, ride }` - Driver assigned (via REST accept → socket)
- `ride:completed` `{ ride, fare }` - Fare final
- `driver:location` `{ driverId, lat, lng, heading, speed }` - Live driver position (ride room)
- `passenger:location` `{ passengerId, lat, lng, heading, speed }` - Live passenger position (ride room)
- `notification:new` `{ _id, type, title, message, data, read, createdAt }` - New in-app notification (user room)

## Seed Credentials

```bash
cd server && npm run seed   # resets users, driver positions and app settings
```

Each account exists on **two domains** — the current `@ridetaxi.com` brand domain and the
legacy `@ellicot.com` domain — with different phone numbers, because sign-in also resolves a
bare phone number. Either login works.

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| admin | `admin@ridetaxi.com` | `admin123` |
| passenger | `passenger@ridetaxi.com` | `pass123` |
| driver (sedan) | `alex@ridetaxi.com` | `driver123` |
| driver (suv) | `sam@ridetaxi.com` | `driver123` |
| admin (legacy) | `admin@ellicot.com` | `admin123` |
| passenger (legacy) | `passenger@ellicot.com` | `pass123` |
| driver (legacy) | `alex@ellicot.com` / `sam@ellicot.com` | `driver123` |

Driver positions are seeded near Howard County, MD (~39.20, -76.85). "Nearby drivers" queries use these seeded `Location` docs — no drivers online until you run the seed.

> **Database is per-app.** `MONGO_URI` must point at `ellicottaxi`, **not** `ridetaxi`. The
> `ridetaxi` database on this machine belongs to a different project (`../RLS`). Sharing it let
> that project's admin accounts authenticate here and granted them Ellicot admin access, and its
> support-phone/email settings overrode ours. Never point two apps at the same database.

## Auth Flow

1. Register → user created `emailVerified:false` + `verificationToken` (hashed, 24h) → verification email sent (SMTP, or console + `verificationLink` **only when `EXPOSE_DEV_TOKENS=true`**). Account is auto-logged-in and the page shows an "Account created" confirmation (it does not auto-redirect).
2. `POST /verify-email?token=` (`/verify-email` page) verifies the account; `VerifyEmailBanner` (App.jsx) shows "verify your email" with a resend button for any logged-in unverified user.
3. Login (`POST /api/auth/login`) is handled by **Passport LocalStrategy** (`usernameField: 'identifier'` → email-or-phone). On success the controller issues a 15m access JWT + an opaque refresh token.
4. Access token embeds `{ id, role, v: tokenVersion }`; `protect` uses the **Passport JWT strategy** and rejects when `v` changes (password reset / logout-all). `TOKEN_EXPIRED` code triggers the client refresh.
5. Refresh tokens are **opaque, stored hashed** in the `RefreshToken` collection with a TTL index (auto-cleanup). `POST /refresh` **atomically rotates** (`findOneAndUpdate` on `revokedAt: null`) → replaying or racing the same token yields exactly one success. `POST /logout` revokes that device's token. Password reset revokes all + bumps `tokenVersion`. There is no `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` — refresh tokens are not JWTs.
6. Social login is the **Passport OAuth2 redirect flow**: `/auth/google` → Google → `/auth/google/callback` → find-or-create/link user → redirect to `/auth/social?accessToken=&refreshToken=` (SPA stores tokens, hard-redirects to `/`). Strategies register only when `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`/`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` or `FACEBOOK_APP_ID`/`FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET` are set; buttons render only when `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`/`VITE_FACEBOOK_APP_ID` are set in `client/.env`. A suspended user is rejected on the callback too, so OAuth cannot be used to bypass a suspension.
7. Phone OTP (`/otp/send` + `/otp/verify`) find-or-creates a `phone`-provider user and issues tokens. One-time code (10 min TTL, 5 attempts); without Twilio the code is logged and returned as `devCode` **only when `EXPOSE_DEV_TOKENS=true`**. Both endpoints coerce `phone` to a string and only accept a 6-digit `code`, so NoSQL operator payloads are rejected rather than executed. OTP send is rate-limited per IP. **Currently disabled in the frontend** (no phone button on Login/Register) — backend endpoints remain for later re-enable.
8. On 401, `api.js` queued-refresh pattern calls `/refresh`, stores the rotated token, retries; on failure clears storage + redirects to `/login`. A `403 Insufficient permissions` also clears + redirects.
9. **Per-role client sessions**: `api.js` stores tokens under per-role keys (`rt_<role>_access` / `rt_<role>_refresh`) with a per-tab active-role marker in `sessionStorage`, so admin/driver/passenger can stay signed in simultaneously in different tabs without overwriting each other. `tokenStore.setActiveRole()` is set on login/register/social and after `getMe`.
10. **The socket handshake never trusts the client's identity**: `socketService.connectSocket(role)` reads the access token and sends only `{ auth: { token } }`. The server re-derives the user and role from the database — see Socket.io Events.

> **Stateless & scalable**: every Passport strategy runs `session:false` — no session store, no sticky sessions, any instance serves any request. Rate limits are per-IP and in-memory per instance (use Redis or a shared store for multi-instance).

## Production Hardening (index.js)

- `helmet()` security headers; `express.json({ limit: '1mb' })`.
- `express-rate-limit`: global API limiter (default 600/15min), auth limiter (60/15min), login limiter (10/15min), OTP limiter (5/10min) — all configurable via `RATE_LIMIT_*` env vars. 429 when exceeded. All four are built by one `limiter()` factory so they cannot drift apart.
- **IPv6**: keys go through `ipKeyGenerator(req.ip)`. Do not use `req.ip` directly in a `keyGenerator` — the library throws in `validate.xForwardedForHeader`, and a naive key also lets a single IPv6 host rotate through `/64`s to bypass the cap.
- **Redis** (`config/redis.js`) is optional. Without `REDIS_URL` the limiters use the in-memory store (per instance); with it they use a `rate-limit-redis` store. `initRedis()` runs before any limiter is constructed — the store cannot be swapped afterwards.
- **Boot-time env validation** (`config/env.js`): `assertEnv()` runs at startup and **throws** in production on a missing/short `<32`-char `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`, a placeholder-looking secret, `EXPOSE_DEV_TOKENS=true`, a login limit above 20, or a localhost `MONGO_URI`. A misconfigured deploy fails immediately instead of running insecurely.
- **Dev-token gate**: registration/OTP/forgot-password only return `verificationLink` / `resetLink` / `devCode` in the response when `EXPOSE_DEV_TOKENS=true`. This is an explicit opt-in, **not** `NODE_ENV` — the app is frequently run in production mode locally, which used to leak live reset links.
- `TRUST_PROXY=true` when behind nginx/Render/Vercel so `req.ip` and rate limits see the real client IP.
- Strict CORS to `CLIENT_ORIGIN` only.
- `process.on('unhandledRejection')` logs; `uncaughtException` logs and exits 1.
- Socket handlers are all wrapped so a bad `ObjectId` or a failed query can never take the process down.

## Deployment

| Target | What to do |
|--------|------------|
| **Vercel** (client) | `client/vercel.json` pins framework/build/output and rewrites all paths to `/index.html` for the SPA. Point the project at `client/`, and set `VITE_API_URL` + `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` as build vars. |
| **Render** (server) | `render.yaml` is a ready blueprint: `rootDir: server`, `npm ci` + `npm start`, `/api/health` health check, 20 secrets declared `sync: false`. `PORT` is supplied by Render — do not hardcode it. |
| **Interserver** (client) | `./scripts/build-interserver.sh <API_URL>` builds and zips the SPA with the API URL baked in. Upload to `public_html`; the SPA fallback ships as `client/public/.htaccess`. Full guide: `docs/DEPLOY-INTERSERVER.md`. |
| **Interserver shared** (server) | cPanel → Setup Node.js App, root `server`, startup `app.js` (a Passenger shim that imports `src/index.js`). Live tracking is degraded here — see the guide's Decision table. |
| **MongoDB Atlas** | Atlas is **not** deployed from this repo, and shared hosting has no MongoDB at all. Create the cluster, add the IP allowlist, and set `MONGO_URI` as a secret. The database name must stay `ellicottaxi`. |

Required in production: `NODE_ENV=production`, `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` (32+ chars, random), `CLIENT_ORIGIN`, `TRUST_PROXY=true`, plus `REDIS_URL` and the third-party keys you actually use. **Never** set `EXPOSE_DEV_TOKENS`.

> **`VITE_*` variables are inlined at BUILD time.** Changing the API host is not a
> restart — it is a rebuild + re-upload. This is the single most common deploy
> mistake: the API moves, the client is not rebuilt, and every request 404s.

## CORS and the mobile app

This API is shared with the **Capacitor mobile app** (separate repo), so it must serve two kinds of
origin. `corsOrigins()` in `config/env.js` builds the allowlist; `index.js` applies the same
predicate to both the REST and the Socket.io server.

| Origin | Sent by |
|---|---|
| `CLIENT_ORIGIN` | the web deploy (Vercel) |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` (comma-separated) | any extra trusted frontend — staging, previews |
| `capacitor://localhost` | the mobile app on iOS — **always allowed** |
| `https://localhost` | the mobile app on Android (`androidScheme: "https"`) — **always allowed** |

Rules that keep this safe and correct:

- **`CLIENT_ORIGIN` stays a single origin.** It is also the base URL for verification and
  password-reset links in outgoing email (`authController.js`, `authService.js`,
  `notificationService.js`). Turning it into a list would put commas in those links. Extra
  frontends belong in `CORS_ORIGINS`.
- A disallowed origin is answered with `cb(null, false)` — no CORS headers, so the browser blocks
  it. Do not "fix" that by returning an error; it turns a blocked cross-origin read into a 500.
- Allowing the native origins is not a hole: auth is a Bearer token in `localStorage`, not an
  ambient cookie, so a hostile page on localhost still has nothing to send. CORS is not an
  authentication mechanism.

> **Deploy this before shipping the app.** While the deployed server is still on a single-origin
> allowlist, the mobile app gets no CORS headers and cannot call the API.


## Audit Log

`middleware/audit.js` wraps `res.json` and writes an `AuditLog` row (actor, actorEmail, actorRole, action, targetType, targetId, ip, userAgent, statusCode, durationMs, path) on a fire-and-forget basis. `targetId` prefers `req.params.id`, then any `_id` in the response, then `key`/`slug`.

**Every mutating admin route must be wrapped in `audit(...)`** — `routes/admin.js` (assign driver, driver toggle, suspend/unsuspend/delete user, content, settings, all fleet + service catalog writes) and `routes/crm.js` (dispatch, no-show, vehicle create/update, ticket create/update). The Audit Log tab is only as trustworthy as that coverage; a new `POST`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` route that mutates state without `audit()` is a gap.


## External API Dependencies (no keys, but need network)

- **Nominatim** (`rideService.geocode`) - free geocoding; sets `User-Agent: RideTaxi/1.0`. Rate-limited (1 req/s).
- **OSRM** (`rideService.getRoute`) - free routing; returns distance/duration/polyline used for fares + map route.

## Key Patterns

### Geospatial Query (find nearby drivers)
```js
// MongoDB 2dsphere query
Location.find({
  coordinates: {
    $near: {
      $geometry: { type: "Point", coordinates: [lng, lat] },
      $maxDistance: radiusInMeters
    }
  }
}).populate('driver');
```

### Socket.io Room Pattern
```js
// Join ride-specific room
socket.join(`ride:${rideId}`);

// Broadcast to room
io.to(`ride:${rideId}`).emit('ride:update', { ride, status });
```

### Route Calculation (OSRM - free)
```js
// GET http://router.project-osrm.org/route/v1/driving/{lng},{lat};{lng},{lat}?overview=full
// Returns polyline geometry for map display
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Token refresh race condition**: Queue failed requests while refresh is in progress
2. **Location updates**: Throttle driver position updates to 1 per 2 seconds max
3. **Map markers**: Use `useMemo` for Leaflet markers to prevent re-render lag
4. **MongoDB geospatial**: Create `2dsphere` index on Location.coordinates
5. **CORS**: Backend must allow `http://localhost:5173` in dev
6. **Rename colors, not classes**: change values in `index.css` `@theme`, never Tailwind class names in components (see Design System)
7. **Don't hardcode new brand hexes in components**: route polyline `#b3221a` is the only allowed exception (Leaflet path options need raw hex)
8. **Payment idempotency**: the client sends a fresh `idempotencyKey` per attempt; a failed attempt's key is burned (409 on replay). `Payment.transactionId`/`idempotencyKey` are `sparse` unique — do not revert to non-sparse (duplicate-key crashes on pending/failed rows).
9. **`paymentsEnabled=false`**: `paymentService` rejects with 403; the UI surfaces the disable notice (PaymentModal fetches `GET /api/settings`). Re-enable via admin Settings tab.
10. **Suspension**: login (`passport.js`), every protected route (`middleware/auth.js`), and refresh rotation all reject `isSuspended` users; admin suspend also revokes their refresh tokens.
11. **Lowercase JSX tags are DOM, not components**: `<icon />` where `icon` is a prop holding a component renders a literal `<icon>` element and logs "unrecognized tag". Always alias it — `const Icon = icon;` then `<Icon />`. Same class of bug for catalog strings: render them through `ui/ServiceIcon.jsx` (`<s.icon />` silently produced `<s>` with an unknown attribute).
12. **One role vocabulary**: import `ADMIN_ROLES` / `hasRole` from `client/src/lib/roles.js` for guards *and* nav. An earlier guard allowed 6 CRM roles while the navbar only linked `role === 'admin'`, so a dispatcher could reach the CRM by URL but had no way to navigate there.
13. **Hash tabs must listen to the URL**: `ContentPage` seeds its tab from `location.hash` on mount, `pushState`s on click, and subscribes to `hashchange`/`popstate`. Without those listeners a deep link opened on an already-mounted page kept the old tab and browser back did nothing.
14. **Red is not a brand color.** `signal-*` is the only red, and only for meaning
    (live/active/failed). Never introduce red for decoration, emphasis or a CTA — the lead is
    Cargo blue. Adding a "highlight" with red is a regression.
15. **Audit new colors before shipping them.** Run `npm run check:contrast` (client) after any
    `@theme` value change. A theme's raw hexes are tuned for large graphics, not body text —
    Cargo's own `#00D084` green is 1.9:1 on a light tint. Keep the hue, re-tune the lightness.
16. **Measure a theme's identity by rendered AREA across SEVERAL pages, not by CSS hit count.**
    Cargo's blue `#0B60A9` looks like plugin CSS on the homepage (0% of area) but is genuinely the
    theme's most-used *text* color on `/transport-company/` (124 uses, ~7% of area). Sampling one
    page would have produced the wrong palette; sampling a representative set is what surfaced the
    real brand color. Note also that the two pages disagree on orange: the homepage has `#FF6900`,
    the inner page has none — so treat "the theme's palette" as per-page, not a single list.
17. **Gradient-clipped text reads as `color: transparent`.** `.text-brand-gradient` paints from its
    own background, so any tool that reads `getComputedStyle(el).color` sees transparent and will
    report a false contrast failure. Skip gradient-clipped, `font-mono` and map/attribution nodes
    in contrast audits.
18. **Catalog writes are audited**: adding an admin `POST`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` without `audit(...)` silently shrinks the Audit Log. See the Audit Log section.
19. **The dotted texture is a generated asset, not a CSS gradient.** `client/scripts/build-dot-world-map.mjs` writes two SVGs to `client/public/assets/` — `dot-world-map.svg` (dark ink, light surfaces) and `dot-world-map-band.svg` (light ink, blue bands). Re-run `node scripts/build-dot-world-map.mjs` after editing `LAND_BOXES`; never hand-edit the SVGs. Two constraints learned the hard way:
    - **The ink is baked per file, not `currentColor`.** `color` is *also* the text colour, so a `text-white` utility on a dotted section silently overrides a `currentColor` ink and paints the dots solid white.
    - **The asset lives in `public/`, not `src/assets/`.** Vite does not rewrite `url()` inside a `background-image` custom property, so a bundled `src/assets` file silently 404s in production.
20. **Cards on a dotted band must be opaque.** A translucent panel (`bg-white/10`) lets the world map read straight through it, which looks like the map is floating in front of the card. Use `bg-surface`, or a solid `brand-900` for a dark card. The map belongs to the band *behind* the content, never on a card.
21. **A quote widget may only contain real product fields.** The hero "Get a quick quote" card is a conversion surface, and anything on it reads as something the customer can actually buy. Every control must map to a real `Ride` field that the booking form also collects — `pickup`, `dropoff`, `vehicleType`, `passengerCount`. A "Round trip" toggle was built and then removed precisely because the `Ride` model has no such field and the booking flow cannot honour it. Do not add a control that the server would ignore. Vehicle choices and seat caps come from the live catalog via `useCatalog()`, so they follow whatever an admin has published rather than a hardcoded list.
22. **Never hardcode business pricing on the client.** `lib/quote.js` mirrors the server's formula and the server's own `FALLBACK_FARE`, and labels the result an estimate. Per-class fares are deliberately not public (`GET /api/fleet` omits `fare`), so a card that shows a per-class price would be inventing it. If accurate per-class quotes are ever wanted, add a public **endpoint** that owns the pricing — do not copy the numbers into the client. Two consequences to respect: the quote must be labelled an estimate, and the rider count must stay capped by the selected class's real `seats`.
23. **The offline catalog fallbacks must mirror the server defaults field for field, and `npm run check:catalog` enforces it.** `data/vehicles.js` and `data/services.js` are what render when `GET /api/fleet` / `/api/services` are slow or unreachable — which is the *normal* case on a deployed site that has not set `VITE_API_URL`, because the client then calls `/api` on its own origin. Both lists have silently drifted, and every symptom was invisible locally, visible only in production:
    - `seats: 4` + `image: ''` on every class → no vehicle photos, and a Van claiming 4 seats.
    - `tagline: ''` + `features: []` on every class → photos and "Book now" rendered but every description and feature list vanished.
    - `icon: ''` + `featured: false` on every service → all service icons blank and the Home featured band emptied outright (12 service links → 7).

    So `check:catalog` diffs both client lists against `FLEET_DEFAULTS` / `SERVICE_DEFAULTS` and exits non-zero on any drift. **Run it after editing either side.** A hand-copied list cannot be trusted; that is the whole reason this check exists. Note the client `icon` is a NAME string for `ServiceIcon`, not a component, and `featured` is compared as a boolean because the server omits it on non-featured offerings.
24. **A background-IMAGE beats a background-color, so `bg-surface` on a primary `Button` is a no-op.** `btn-brand-gradient` sets `background-image`, which paints over the `background-color` that `bg-surface` sets — but `!text-brand-900` still wins the text. The result is dark text on the blue gradient at **1.45:1**, i.e. invisible. Five CTAs carried `bg-surface !text-brand-900` for this reason. On a blue band, use the default primary variant and let the white text stand; only invert when you also remove the gradient. `check:contrast` prints this pairing as a documented, non-gated trap.
25. **Let a photo set its own height when the whole subject must be visible.** The Home image band used `h-72 sm:h-96` + `object-cover`, which cropped the roof and wheels off the sedan. Use `w-full` with no fixed height so the section matches the source aspect exactly, overlay the scrim on top, and move the copy below the image on small screens rather than squeezing it over the photo.
26. **The logo's wordmark is navy, so the logo always needs a light plate.** `public/images/logo-full.png` is the full lockup (car/plane/tower graphic + "ELLIOTT CITY / AIRPORT TAXI" wordmark). Every band in this design is `bg-brand-gradient` navy, so dropping the logo straight onto one makes the wordmark invisible, and the dark car graphic disappears too. It therefore always sits inside a white rounded plate. Two different crops, because two different jobs:
    - **`logo-full.png` (full lockup)** — the footer and the auth aside, where there is vertical room.
    - **`logo-mark.png` (graphic only)** — the navbar. The full lockup at navbar height is ~28px wide and its wordmark is illegible, so the navbar pairs the mark with the name set as live text. Do not swap the mark for the full lockup here.
27. **The logo assets are generated, not hand-edited.** `client/scripts/build-logo-assets.py` derives every one from two sources and takes both as arguments. They are **byte-reproducible** — re-run and the md5 must not change.
    - `logo-full.png` (480×315, footer + auth) comes from the **source artwork** with a **border flood fill**, not a global white→transparent pass: a global pass punches holes through the car's white paint highlights and the swoosh. Verified 0% holes on every solid body panel.
    - `logo-mark.png` (197×84, navbar) comes from the **remove.bg export**, then `repair_interior_holes()` puts back the pixels that tool wrongly deleted. Flood the transparent region in from the border: what the flood reaches is real background, what is transparent and *unreached* is an interior hole, restored from the pixel-aligned source. Keep the two sources the same dimensions or the repair silently misaligns.
    - Both are exported at **3×** their CSS display size for retina, not at the 612×408 source size — the mark went 130 KB → 26 KB that way. `favicon.png` 512, `apple-touch-icon.png` 180.
28. **A near-transparent region in this artwork is not necessarily damage.** The studio background is a flat luminance 247, and the windscreen glass is *also* median 247 — the same tone. So a background remover making the glass transparent produces a difference of 247 vs 255 on the white plate, which is imperceptible. Measure what actually reaches the screen before calling a hole a bug; `logo-full.png` is ~195 KB because the lockup has 28k distinct colours (photographic), and WebP would take it to ~57 KB if that trade is ever worth making.
